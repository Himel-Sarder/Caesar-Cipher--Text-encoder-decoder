## What is Caesar Cipher?   
Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of 3:   
A becomes D   
B becomes E   
C becomes F   
...   
X becomes A   
Y becomes B   
Z becomes C

## Features
- Encrypt text using a specified shift value
- Decrypt text using the same shift value
- Support for both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Command-line interface for easy usage

## Installation
To install the Caesar Cipher program, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Himel-Sarder/Caesar-Cipher--Text-encoder-decoder.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd caesar cipher`

## Usage
To use the Caesar Cipher program, run the following command:
```
python caesar cipher.py
```
Follow the prompts to enter the text to encrypt or decrypt, the shift value, and the desired operation (encode or decode).

## Examples
Suppose we have the plaintext message "HELLO" and we want to encrypt it using a Caesar Cipher with a shift value of 3:   
Determine the shift value: In this case, it's 3.   
Map each letter of the plaintext to its corresponding letter after shifting by 3:   
'H' becomes 'K'   
'E' becomes 'H'   
'L' becomes 'O'   
'L' becomes 'O'   
'O' becomes 'R'   
Combine the shifted letters to form the encrypted message: "KHOOH".   
So, the encrypted message for "HELLO" using a Caesar Cipher with a shift value of 3 is "KHOOH".

## FAQ
**Q: What is the maximum shift value supported by the Caesar Cipher program?**   
A: The maximum shift value is 25, which corresponds to shifting the entire alphabet by one position.   

**Q: Can I use negative shift values to encrypt text in reverse?**   
A: Yes, negative shift values can be used to encrypt text in reverse order, but decryption will require a positive shift value.
